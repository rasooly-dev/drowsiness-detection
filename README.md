# Detecting Drowsiness using Object Detection & CNN's

### Abstract
Driving is an essential part of modern life, encompassing routine activities such as trips to the supermarket, commuting to work and school, and embarking on long-distance journeys. Given its ubiquity, ensuring the safety of drivers is paramount. One of the most critical factors affecting road safety is driver drowsiness, which significantly increases the risk of accidents. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, driver drowsiness is implicated in an estimated 328,000 crashes each year. To address this pressing issue, our project aims to develop an advanced system capable of detecting driver drowsiness through real-time video stream analysis.

Our approach involves leveraging computer vision and supervised machine learning techniques to perform object detection and classification, thereby accurately identifying drowsy states. Upon detecting drowsiness, the system will issue incrementing audible alerts to the driver. This proactive alert mechanism aims to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue.
